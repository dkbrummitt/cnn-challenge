CNN Developer Interview Challenge(CDIC) is a technical coding challenge for
testing a candidates skills and aptitude. The challenge is outlined below:

<a name="Description"></a>
We would like you to develop a responsive page that displays twitter feeds. We
would like you to show us your cool front-end skills and also your ability to
develop a node.js server (HAPI or Express, etc) that uses the Twitter API to
get a feed.  This is an opportunity to show us how you develop. We want to see
your coding style, use of open source libs, testing approach, documentation,
creativity, etc.  You may use any open source libs or available code to support
your solution but you must be able to explain your code if you are selected to
come in for an in-person interview.  If you have questions, you may send them
to the challenge proctor  but no immediate responses should be
expected.  State any assumptions and move on as the clock for completing the
task does not pause.
